	if statement
	if else statement
	nested if else statements
	switch statements
	
	If statements
		boolean expression followed by one or more statements
	if else statement
		boolean expression followed by one or more statements if boolean expression is false then it will execute else block statements
	nested if statements
		one boolean followed by another boolean
	switch
		allows a variable tested against a set of values
		each value is called a statement
		the variable being switched on is checked for each case
		variables used in switch are only integers, convertible integers(byte,short,char), Strings,enums
		we can write any no.of case statements
		value of case should be same datatype as switch and it must be a constant or literal
		When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.
		When a break statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line following the switch statement.
		Not every case needs to contain a break. If no break appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent cases until a break is reached.
		A switch statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case
