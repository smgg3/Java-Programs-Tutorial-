Basic Operators
	Arithmetic Operators
		addition
		subtract
		multiply]
		division
		modulus
		increment
		decrement
	Relational Operators
		equal(==)
		not equal(!=)
		greater than 
		less than
		greater than or equal
		less than or equal
	Bitwise Operators
		applied to long int short byte char
		| or
		& and
		^ bitwise XOR
		~ bitwise compliment
		<<  left shift
		>> right shift
		>>> zero fill right shift
	Logical Opearators
		&&
		||
		!
	Assignment Operators
		=
		+=
		-=
		*=
		/=
		%=
		<<=
		>>=
		&=
		|=
		^=
	Miscellaneous Operators
		Conditional Operators (?:) ternary operator
		instanceof operator
			(object reference variable) instanceof (class/interface type)
			it is a IS-A  relationship
			it returns true if the object being compared is the assignment compatible with the type on the right
			Ex: 
			Operators obj=new MiscellaneousOperators();
		
			boolean e=obj instanceof Operators;
		
			boolean f=obj instanceof MiscellaneousOperators;
