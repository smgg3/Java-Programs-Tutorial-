Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values.
Two types
	Primitive	-predefined by the language and keyword
	Reference /Object-
Primitive Datatypes
byte
	1 byte
	8 bit signed 2's complement number(-128 to 127)
	default is 0
	pro
		used to save space in large arrays
short
	2bytes
	16 bit signed 2's complement number(-32,768 to 32,767)
	default is 0
	pro
		used to save space in large arrays
long
	8 bytes
	 64 bit signed 2's complement number(-2^63 to 2^63-1)
	 default is 0L
int
	4 bytes
	 32 bit signed 2's complement number(-2^31 to 2^31-1)
	 default datatype for integral values
	 default is 0
float
	4 bytes
	single precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
	used to save memory in large arrays of floating values
	never used for precise values such as currency
	default value is 0.0f
double
	8 bytes
	double precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
	defualt datatype for decimal values
	never be used for precise values such as currency
	default is 0.0d
char
	2 bytes
	16 bit Unicode chracter
	min value is\u0000
	max is \uffff
boolean
	1 bit
	true/false
	used for flags to track contiditions
	default value is false
Reference Variables
	are created using defined constructors of the classes
	Ex: class objects and arrays of specific type
	default value is null

Literals
	it is a source code representation of a fixed value.
special escape sequences
	\n-newline
	\r carriage return
	\f form feed
	\b back space
	\s space
	\t tab
	\uxxxx unicode
	\ddd octal
