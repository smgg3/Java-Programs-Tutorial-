		Stream
			defined as a sequence of data.
			InputStream
				used to read data from a source
			OutputStream 
				used to write data to output destination
		ByteStreams
			used to perform i/p and o/p of 8-bit bytes
			most frequently used classes are FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
			FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
				Ex:
					import java.io.*;
					public class FileInputOutputStreamCopyFile {
					
						public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
							
							FileInputStream input=new FileInputStream("C://Users//Sravani Chowdary//Documents//GitHub//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//src//com//test//filesnio//input.txt");
							FileOutputStream output=new FileOutputStream("C://Users//Sravani Chowdary//Documents//GitHub//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//src//com//test//filesnio//output.txt");

								output.write(s);
							}
							if(input!=null)
								input.close();
							if(output!=null)
								output.close();
						}
					}
		Character Stream
			used to perform input output of 16-bit unicode
			frequently used character streams are FileReader and FileWriter
			internally both uses FileInputStream and FileOutputStream but FileReader reads and FileWriter writes 2 bytes at a time i.e 16 bit
			Ex:
				import java.io.*;
				public class FileReaderWriterCopyFile {
				
					public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
						
						FileReader input=new FileReader("C://Users//Sravani Chowdary//Documents//GitHub//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//src//com//test//filesnio//input.txt");
						FileWriter output=new FileWriter("C://Users//Sravani Chowdary//Documents//GitHub//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//src//com//test//filesnio//output.txt");
						int count=0;
						int s;
						while((s=input.read())!=-1){
							output.write(s);
							count++;
						}
						System.out.println(count);
						if(input!=null)
								input.close();
						if(output!=null)
								output.close();	
					}

		Standard Streams
		
		InputStreamWriter
			Like C C++ provides STDOUT,STDIN,STDERR Java also provides three standard streams
			3 standard streams
				Standard Input
					This is used to feed the data to user's program and usually a keyboard is used as standard input stream and represented as System.in.
				Standard Output
					This is used to output the data produced by the user's program and usually a computer screen is used for standard output stream and represented as System.out.
				Standard Error
					This is used to output the error data produced by the user's program and usually a computer screen is used for standard error stream and represented as System.err.
				Ex:
					import java.io.*;
					public class InputStreamReaderCommandLine {
					
						public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
							
							InputStreamReader input=new InputStreamReader(System.in);
							char c;
							System.out.println("Enter q to quit");
							do{
								c=(char)input.read();
								System.out.print(c);
							}while(c!='q');
							
							if(input!=null)
									input.close();
						}

		ByteArrayInputStream ByteOutputStream
			Class allows a buffer in the memory to be used as an InputStream
			Input source is an byte array
			Constructors
					ByteArrayInputStream(byte [] a)
							This constructor accepts a byte array as a parameter.
					ByteArrayInputStream(byte [] a, int off, int len)
							This constructor takes an array of bytes, and two integer values, where off is
							the first byte to be read and len is the number of bytes to be read.
			Constructors
					ByteArrayOutputStream()
							This constructor creates a ByteArrayOutputStream having buffer of 32 byte
					ByteArrayOutputStream(int a)
							This constructor creates a ByteArrayOutputStream having buffer of the given size
					
			Methods
				public int read() This method reads the next byte of data from the InputStream. Returns an int as the next byte of data. If it is the end of the file, then it returns -1.
				public int read(byte[] r, int off, int len) This method reads upto len number of bytes starting from off from the input stream into an array. Returns the total number of bytes read. 
															If it is the end of the file, -1 will be returned.
				public int available() Gives the number of bytes that can be read from this file input stream. Returns an int that gives the number of bytes to be read.
				public void mark(int read) This sets the current marked position in the stream. The parameter gives the maximum limit of bytes that can be read before the marked position becomes invalid.
				public long skip(long n) Skips ‘n’ number of bytes from the stream. This returns the actual number of bytes skipped.	
			Methods
				public void reset()This method resets the number of valid bytes of the byte array output stream to zero, so all the accumulated output in the stream will be discarded.
				public byte[] toByteArray() This method creates a newly allocated Byte array. Its size would be the current size of the output stream and the contents of the buffer will be
											copied into it. Returns the current contents of the output stream as a byte array.
				public String toString() Converts the buffer content into a string. Translation will be done according to the default character encoding. Returns the String translated from the buffer's content.
				public void write(int w) Writes the specified array to the output stream.
				public void write(byte []b, int of, int len) Writes len number of bytes starting from offset off to the stream.
				public void writeTo(OutputStream outSt) Writes the entire content of this Stream to the specified stream argument.				
			Ex:
				import java.io.*;
				public class ByteArrayInputOutputStream {
				
					public static void main(String[] args) {

		DataInputStream DataOutputStream
			The DataInputStream is used in the context of DataOutputStream and can be used to read primitives.
			InputStream in = DataInputStream(InputStream in);
			DataOutputStream out = DataOutputStream(OutputStream out);
			Methods
				public final int read(byte[] r, int off, int len)throws IOException
						Reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes.
						Returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer otherwise -1 if it is end of file.
				Public final int read(byte [] b)throws IOException
						Reads some bytes from the inputstream an stores in to the byte array. Returns
						the total number of bytes read into the buffer otherwise -1 if it is end of file.
				(a) public final Boolean readBooolean()throws IOException
				(b) public final byte readByte()throws IOException
				(c) public final short readShort()throws IOException
				(d) public final Int readInt()throws IOException
						These methods will read the bytes from the contained InputStream. Returns the next two bytes of the InputStream as the specific primitive type.
				public String readLine() throws IOException
						Reads the next line of text from the input stream. It reads successive bytes,cconverting each byte separately into a character, until it encounters a line
						terminator or end of file; the characters read are then returned as a String.
			Methods
				public final void write(byte[] w, int off, int len)throws IOException Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at point off, to the underlying stream.
				Public final int write(byte [] b)throws IOException Writes the current number of bytes written to this data output stream. Returns the total number of bytes written into the buffer.
				(a) public final void writeBooolean()throws IOException,
				(b) public final void writeByte()throws IOException,
				(c) public final void writeShort()throws IOException
				(d) public final void writeInt()throws IOException
						These methods will write the specific primitive type data into the output stream as bytes.
				Public void flush()throws IOException Flushes the data output stream.
				public final void writeBytes(String s) throws IOException Writes out the string to the underlying output stream as a sequence of bytes. Each character in the string is written out, in sequence, by discarding its high eight bits.
			Ex:
				import java.io.*;
				public class DataInputOutputStream {
				
					public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException{
						
						File fop=new File("C://Users//Sravani Chowdary//Documents//GitHub//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//Java-Programs-Tutorial-//src//com//test//filesnio//dataoutput.txt");
						if(!fop.exists())
							fop.createNewFile();
						else
							System.out.println("Output Already File Exists");
						
						DataOutputStream output=new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fop));
						output.writeUTF("Sravani");
						
						DataInputStream input =new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(fop));
						int count=0;
						while(input.available()>0){
							System.out.println(input.readUTF());
							count++;
						}
						System.out.println("count :" +count);
					}

		Directories in JAVA
			A directory is a File which can contain a list of other files and directories. You use File object to create directories, to list down files available in a directory		
			Creating Directories
				The mkdir( ) method creates a directory, returning true on success and false on
					failure. Failure indicates that the path specified in the File object already exists, or
					that the directory cannot be created because the entire path does not exist yet.
				The mkdirs() method creates both a directory and all the parents of the directory.	
			Note: Java automatically takes care of path separators on UNIX and Windows as per
				conventions. If you use a forward slash (/) on a Windows version of Java, the path will still resolve correctly.
